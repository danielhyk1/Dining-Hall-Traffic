# Dining-Hall-Traffic
Machine learning through Scikit, organize and prepare for traffic in the dining halls

Functionalities:
1. Built-in parser for csv files of door data, building codes, and (fake) student IDs
2. Decision-tree classifier, given data from csv files, to predict amount of traffic in the dining hall.
  -Takes parameters of  the college, day of the week, swipes by 11:45am, swipes by 12:00pm, and swipes by 12:15pm to predict if it will be a low, average, or high traffic day
3. Decition tree to predict whether students should be given notifications about "behaviors of concern" given parameters of skipping meals, classes, and lack of swiping into buildings and residential colleges
